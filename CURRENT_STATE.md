# Current State: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Branch**: `phase1-streaming-pinch-detector`
**Last Commit**: `661309e` - "Implement Phase 1: Streaming DSP Core for real-time pinch detection"

## Project Context
Implementing real-time pinch detection for Apple Watch to eliminate iPhone dependency. Following the plan in `WATCH_REALTIME_DETECTION_PLAN.md`.

**Issues being addressed**: #28 (Port PinchDetector to Watch), #30 (Integrate StreamingPinchDetector), #22 (Real-time TKEO on Watch)

## Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED

### What was implemented:
- **StreamingPinchDetector.swift**: Core streaming DSP pipeline
  - Single-sample processing API: `process(frame: SensorFrame) -> PinchEvent?`
  - Causal filtering (no zero-phase delay for real-time)
  - TKEO operators with 3-sample sliding buffers
  - L2 sensor fusion (accelerometer + gyroscope)
  - Reuses O(1) StreamingBaselineMad from Issue #27

- **Phase1ValidationView**: Test interface in CompanionContentView.swift
  - Validates streaming pipeline produces reasonable outputs
  - Copy button for full test results
  - Tests on real sensor data from Watch sessions

### Key architectural decisions:
- **Causal filtering only**: Eliminates `bandpassZeroPhase` (uses future data)
- **Component-based design**: Small stateful helpers for each pipeline stage
- **Fixed-size buffers**: Circular buffers for Watch memory constraints
- **Streaming state machines**: Replace batch array operations

### Validation results:
✅ Fused signal range: [0.000 - 0.625]
✅ Baseline range: [0.002 - 0.018]
✅ Sigma range: [0.000 - 0.016]
✅ Processing: <1ms per sample (much faster than batch)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Phase 2 Implementation

### Phase 2: Peak Detection State Machine (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Replace batch peak detection with streaming state machine

**Key components to implement:**

1. **StreamingPeakDetector state machine**:
   ```swift
   enum PeakState { case belowGate, rising, falling }
   ```
   - Gate threshold computation per sample
   - State transitions: belowGate → rising → falling → belowGate
   - Refractory period tracking (150-200ms)

2. **Integration into StreamingPinchDetector**:
   - Add `StreamingPeakDetector` instance
   - Process fused signal through peak detector
   - Return peak candidates with timestamps

3. **Gyro veto mechanism**:
   - Replace array-based logic (lines 693-697 in PinchDetector.swift)
   - Implement as run-length counter for streaming

**Files to modify:**
- `DhikrCounter/StreamingPinchDetector.swift`: Add peak detection
- `DhikrCounter/CompanionContentView.swift`: Update validation to test peaks

**Validation criteria:**
- Peak timing matches batch version (±phase delay from causal filtering)
- Refractory period correctly enforced
- Gate threshold computation matches batch algorithm

### Phase 2 Implementation Steps:

1. **Add StreamingPeakDetector class** to StreamingPinchDetector.swift
2. **Implement state machine logic** with proper transitions
3. **Add refractory period tracking** (time-based, not sample-based)
4. **Integrate with main process() method**
5. **Update Phase1ValidationView** to show peak detection results
6. **Test and validate** peak timing vs batch implementation

### Key Code References (from existing PinchDetector.swift):
- Gate threshold logic: Look at how `gateThreshold` is computed
- Peak detection algorithm: Lines 513-532 (batch version to convert)
- Refractory period: How it's currently implemented in batch
- Gyro veto: Lines 693-697 (array logic to convert to streaming)

### Success Criteria for Phase 2:
- Streaming detector finds peaks in real-time
- Peak timing within ±20ms of batch version (accounting for causal delay)
- Refractory period prevents false triggers
- Processing remains <0.5ms per sample

## Current Environment:
- **Xcode**: Building successfully for iPhone 16 Pro simulator
- **App**: Installed and running with Phase 1 validation interface
- **Git**: Clean working tree, ready for Phase 2 branch

## Notes for Resume:
- Phase 1 validation interface is working - use it to test Phase 2
- The streaming DSP core is solid, focus on peak detection state machine
- Consider causal delay (~10-20ms) when comparing peak timing
- Template matching (Phase 3) comes after peak detection works
